This historic document was printed by the Security-Columbian Banknote Company and has an ornate border around it with a vignette of an allegorical man and woman sitting beside the company\'s logo. This item has the printed signatures of the company_s chairman (Robert L. Stone) and vice-presidentfinance and assistant secretary. This bond is over 34 years old. Hertz the world\'s leading vehicle renting organization is represented in over 140 countries operating a fleet of 525000 vehicles from approximately 6500 locations. The pioneer of auto renting was Walter L. Jacobs who in September of 1918 at the age of 22 opened a car-rental operation in Chicago. Starting with a dozen Model T Fords which he repaired and repainted himself Jacobs expanded his operation to the point where within five years the business generated annual revenues of about $1 million. In 1923 Jacobs sold his car-rental concern to John Hertz President of Yellow Cab and Yellow Truck and Coach Manufacturing Company. Jacobs continued as Hertz\' top operating and administrative executive. This rental business called Hertz Drive-Ur-Self System was acquired in 1926 by General Motors Corporation when it bought Yellow Truck from John Hertz. The Hertz Corporation In 1953 the Hertz properties were bought from GMC by the Omnibus Corporation which divested itself of its bus interest and concentrated solely on car and truck renting and leasing. A year later a new name was taken -- The Hertz Corporation -- and it was listed for the first time on the New York Stock Exchange. Jacobs became Hertz\' first President and served in that post until his retirement in 1960. He died in 1985 at the age of 88. In 1954 the new corporation bought Metropolitan Distributors a pioneer in New York truck leasing dating back to World War I and the largest concern of its kind in any one city. In the process the head of Metropolitan Leon C. Greenbaum became Vice Chairman of the Hertz Board of Directors; he later became Chairman and in 1960 Chief Executive Officer. In 1967 The Hertz Corporation became a wholly owned subsidiary of RCA Corporation and operated as a separate entity with its own management and Board of Directors. In 1985 Hertz joined UAL Inc. On December 30 1987 Hertz was sold to Park Ridge Corporation a company formed by Ford Motor Company and Hertz management for the purpose of purchasing Hertz. In 1988 Volvo North America Corporation joined Ford and Hertz management as an investor in Park Ridge Corporation. In 1993 Park Ridge Corporation was merged into The Hertz Corporation. In 1994 Ford purchased the outstanding shares of Hertz and Hertz became an independent wholly owned subsidiary of The Ford Motor Company. On April 25 1997 Hertz became a publicly traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol HRZ. Hertz Today Hertz is headquartered in Park Ridge New Jersey. Its current headquarters location opened in 1988. Prior to that the corporation was based in New York and before that Chicago. Oklahoma City Oklahoma is the site of Hertz\' Worldwide Reservations Center and Data Center established in 1970 and its Financial Center established in 1994. Car rentals the largest and best known of Hertz\' activities are conducted from more than 1600 domestic corporate and licensee locations and approximately 4500 corporate and licensee locations outside the United States. Hertz offers a wide variety of current-model cars on a short-term rental basis -- daily weekly or monthly -- at airports in downtown and suburban business centers and in residential areas and resort locales.

Items not paid for in the specified time may be withheld from the non-paying bidder and may relisted. 2.) Non-paying Bidders Will Receive A Non-Paying Bidders Notice To eBay And Face Negative Feedback And Ultimately Termination Of Their eBay Account If They Make A Habit Of Not Paying For Auctions. 3.) All Sales Final Unless Otherwise Marked So Please Ask Any Questions Before You Bid. 4.)

Canadian and European customers are encouraged to use PayPal or Bid Pay for payments. 8.) If you pay with PayPal and you have won multiple items PLEASE make only 1 PayPal Payment and include all the auction numbers on the one payment. It simplifies it for you and for me.

The cgc census report is now avalable on their web site cgccomics.com (as of 7-12-01). I strongly encourage all serious bidders to visit this site especially when bidding on more expensive or scarce books. Many of the books I offer up on ebay and on my website are of the highest slabbed grades at present or in a good number of times-the ONLY book of it\'s kind to have been graded. This information is powerful when buying selling or bidding. I am a CGC Charter member and AACC member. My grading is guaranteed-refering to unslabbed books naturally- I have been a collector and seller/dealer for over 35 years. Many references available if you need them. If not satisfied I will return a full refund for the books as long as they are returned in original condition. All items packed securely. Shipping is $6 in the Cont.USA. Insurance is extra-$2 and up-(for merchadise $100 or more) depending on price of book and I will not be responsible for uninsured books(anything over $100). I usually ship ONCE a week depending on volume (sometimes more) using either USPS-priority mail OR Fed Ex ground either takes 2-4 days. All CGC books are non returnable I will warrenty against any cracks in the slab though. Most (USPS) books sent by certified. Overseas postage is at LEAST $15 per package so please keep this in mind if you are bidding from overseas or just please refrain from bidding. Also most bidders are honorable but do not bid if you are unsure that you can make payment and agree to terms. For USA orders you may combine up to 5 CGC books and up to 12 non CGC books per order.

It is 5 1/8 inches tall and has 3 sunken panels. It is embossed: DAVIS arched in a recessed square on the front and VEGETABLE on left side and PAIN KILLER on the other side. Has a nice applied double collar and beveled edges. Similar to Greer\'s but this size not listed. Digger Odell states in his book Pontil Medicine Encyclopedia that Perry Davis was a carpenter and discovered this formula and began selling this medicine in a basket-What a change in occupations. Digger does not list this size either. This medicine was also referred to in the classic novel of Tom Sawyer. The condition is good-it is dug with a nice haze. No chips dings or cracks in the glass. The glass is crude and has wonderful whittle. The base is the real odd feature-has a horseshoe type key mold an x on each side with a nice open pontil in the center. Would make a nice addition to any Early pre-civil war or Pontiled Medicine bottle collection. No reserve. Thank you for looking at this item and God Bless.

MEDIA: We have been shipping media items (records books etc.) by Media mail but have experienced slow delivery times so we are trying to move away from this service. Smaller light-weight media items over 13 ozs. are still quoted for Media mail and the bidder may request a different delivery service. However we WILL NOT be held responsible for the long amount of time any Media mail shipment may take. SMALLER ITEMS: Other smaller items up to 13 ozs. are shipped first class. All other items are shipped either Priority mail or FedEx. Usually anything over a few pounds is shipped via FedEx hence the higher costs. However their exemplary service is guarenteed carries automatic insurance up to $100 in value and is trackable with out additional cost. Any item shipped through the USPS Priority service without requesting additional services such as delivery confirmation can not be tracked nor will we be held responsibility for its not being delivered (see insurance disclaimer above). LARGER ITEMS: Larger items such as furniture and such are shipped either with BAX Global or a local mover we use who makes east coast runs every two-three weeks. HANDLING FEES: Since our shipping department needs to eat (and we require him to wear shoes please! ) and shipping materials do cost money (really!) all items have an appropriate handling fee. Basically the more time and care taken to prepare an item for safe transport the higher the fee. We do our best to provide both cost effective and careful handling of packaging your item. This fee is not negotiable is usually reflected in all posted S&H charges or added to shipping quotes for larger items.

NM 1970 ASTONISHING TALES 1 - 8 : KAZAR & DR DOOM QUESTIONS: click here to send an e-mail CONDITION : NEAR MINT OPENING BID: $9.99 HOW TO PAY? MONEY ORDER & PAYPAL HOW TO SHIP? I ship via United States Postal Service for both domestic and international. You pay only the cost required to ship. I do not believe in padding auctions by adding unjustified extra charges. I don\'t like it when people do it to me so I won\'t do it to you. PICTURES: Click on each to get a larger view. _ #1 #7 HONESTY POLICY I have met people in my store who won books on E-Bay that were nowhere near the condition described. It angers me as a seller because it ruins the reputations of dealers as a whole. Simply put it hurts our market by driving away customers. How Do I Grade? I look at every book and grade it according to six categories: front cover back cover corners edges spine & staples interior pages. I give a complete description of each of these sections noting any flaws or defects. Also I include large scans of the front and back covers. When I have completed the auction page I am satisfied that you know exactly what you are bidding on and that there will be no surprises at auction\'s end. So what about returns? At first I offered returns on books. Then I quickly discovered that some people would outbid everyone else by an excessively high amount just to get a look at the book then ask for a return if they decided they didn\'t want it. I no longer offer returns. I am confident in my grading and description and have never had a complaint about either. If you are not sure that you want the book then don\'t bid on it. COMPLETE DESCRIPTION: _ All books have come from the same collection and have received the same care over the years. Title: Astonishing Tales Featuring Kazar and Dr. Doom Issue(s) & Date(s): #1 August 1970 - #8 October 1971 Double feature books. Issues feature work by Kirby Wood and Barry Smith.

The only exception to this would be Issue # 200 which has some dark scuffing amidst the white background. Amazing the newest one is the worst.. and even it\'s prob at least a Fine grade comic. I believe issue 141 is the first appearance of Doc Samson.. saw it on here for about $50 all by itself and prob not as good as this one.. It looks about perfect to me. Issues 123124129130 and 131 have store date stamps on the light part of the covers.. but nothing major.. other than that they appear to be NM. It would take me forever to look at each and every page of this many comics but the few I opened and checked only showed to be a little off-white around the edges.. and near the center. Nothing out of the ordinary for a 30 year old comic. Saw no creases or any other obvious blemishes.. other than those with the store dates. All are bagged and boarded.. and rather than risk damaging them in scans I chose to scan them in the covers so if you see a little shimmer .. it\'s the scan... not the comic. I really don\'t think you\'ll be dissapointed in any way with the condition of these comics. If so just tell me within 3 days and I\'ll refund your money.. minus shipping. I think that\'s a fair proposition. Trying to describe these as best I can so you\'ll know what you\'re getting before you bid. I haven\'t researched anything as to their true value.. I\'ll leave it to some savy bidders to do the research and bid accordingly. I\'ll start the bidding at $60 which I believe is a steal for this quality and quantity. I hate to set any limits at all but I feel 2 dollars a book is a pretty good buy.Sentimentally they\'re worth a lot more to me.. a part of my youth I held on to for all these years. You probably can\'t get that many brand new comics at that price. Much less true collector items. Anyways.. that\'s the deal. Hope you like what you see. Will accept PayPal Money Orders and Cashiers Check. Shipping will be a flat 7 dollars which will include: Well packed USPS Priority Shipping Tracking # and insurance covering the total bid price. May cost more to do all this.. will be a fairly heavy package but I lean towards the buyer when it comes to shipping charges.

The Miao place great emphasis on their costumes which are made up of decorative fabrics which they achieve by pattern weaving and wax resist. Almost all the Miao decorate hemp and cotton (not silk) by applying hot wax then dipping the cloth in an indigo dye. The cloth is then used for skirts panels on jackets aprons and baby carriers. Indigo is used chiefly for the basic cloth throughout Guizo to give dark blues. A paste is made from the harvested plants which have been soaked in a wooden barrel. Wax resisted fabric was probably one of the earliest forms of decoration in Guizhou as all the materials were at hand. Beeswax is the main ingredient but other resins or wax are possibly added. The wax resist never exploits crackle the aim is to produce a clear image and beeswax is both tenacious and flexible. The wax is often heated in a little pot resting in hot embers. Once applied the wax appears black on the fabric but at the end of the process the wax is removed from the fabric. The fabric is then rinsed in cool water and air dried. The beeswax can be reused. The usual tools for applying wax are of copper and brass with bamboo handles. They are made from 2 small triangular pieces of metal their apexes bound to a bamboo holder by copper wire. It is held like a pen either upright or at a slant to the cloth which is laid flat on a board. This tool lends itself to the drawing of straight or slightly curving lines. The Miao Gejia and Bouyei girls are highly skilled at batik. They use very finely drawn circular and double spiral designs representing the horns of the water buffalo symbolising their ancestor\'s life and death. Girls start learning to produce batik from the age of 6 and 7 years. The finest work is found on baby carriers sleeves of their jackets and skirts. The more traditional designs are geometric where the most skilled wax resist reads as a fine blue line on a white ground. With the influence of the Han Chinese more figurative designs like flowers birds fish have been introduced over the centuries.

Please click here to see my other auctions. Please do not email me to request that I stop an auction to sell you an item privately. It is my firm policy that once I start an auction I will let it follow through to completion (except in unusual cases such as breakage or erroneous listing). I do not think it fair to other potential bidders to put an item up and then pull it to make a quick sale. I try to offer my merchandise at the lowest possible price without a reserve and therefore after the auction I do not cut prices on unsold items to bidders who make me an offer. I relist them and may or may not reduce the starting price.

This group of X men are mostly warehouse copies.Also note that this scan generally will overstate defects (Read what the buyer of a $1000.00 AF 15 recently said about our scan-nov 28 2001 feedback or just to confirm read the Dec 3 2001 feedback of a VF Green Lantern purchase OR read what a buyer of a nm Thor saidPinpoint grading (an ebay rarity!) Recommend this seller.Dec 3 2001)).All grades are guarenteed within 0.5 of any grading service. The grade quoted above is an accurate grade reflecting the true condition of the book.(Any defect not revealed by the large scan will be discussed apart).The price is set so that you will be hard pressed to find as good a deal anywhere else.(This 33% bigger scan( than the books\' actual size) magnifies and enlarges defects-it is like looking at the book through a magnification factor). Generally speaking the book possess\'s a solid intact spine with no splits;staples solidly in place;corners sharp;gloss and color deapth vividdeep and close to new in appearance;only minor spine stress marks may exist(similar to thoses produced at original printing);overall a glossy off white to WHITE paged copy offered at an unbeatable initial bid with a LOW RESERVE(This low reserve allows our customers to use the buy it now feature.Many have missed out on previous booksand this feature usually prolongs the auction a bit longer to give everyone a chance to bid).As we have a large multiple grade inventory of Silver and Golden age booksmany will be offered for sale in coming ads.There are many comics being auctioned off on Ebay this week.Combine auctions to save postage.THOUSANDS of other books are still to come including most Marvel and DC titles from 1960 -1972.Use the BUY IT NOW feature to end the auction and lock out the competition.

Here are the reasons; 1)All defects are CLEARLY seen.(in our opinion a small scan is of no use-the grade can be anything). 2) By revealing all defectsyou can grade based upon what you like or dislike about a book. 3) No two grades have the same defectsthus a large scan allows you to delineate the key aspects of the book. 4)A large scan will OVERSTATE defects.Defects appear LARGER than what you will see when you get the book.(This applies especially to creases(thicker than actual)and stress marksand to a lesser extent to color toneswhich may show gradations in color not visible with the naked eye).Most of our customers note that the book is nicer when it arrives than what this scan revealed(reasons;the scans bright flood light reveal evey single microscopic impact pointplus defects appear 33% larger.) 5)All our books are guaranteed to be in the same general grade range(within+/- 0.5) if the book is slabbed(within 14 days of purchase) 6) Full exchange privledges on any item purchased.within 7 days. 7) Shipping : Cost; 5.00 for less than 5 comics(priority mail with delivery confirmation) in North America NOTE ;Allow 2 weeks for material to reach you;we often beat thatbut increased security screening by the post office can delay shipping time;we take full responsibility.... ..Questions and/or comments?

I do not collect trivets so any information I include here is only what was passed to me as I can not claim any personal expertise in the area. This cast iron trivet is a nice match to another one of my listings with a single turtledove. This trivet has a heart handle with an iron stand shaped plate. The main body has a two headed turtle dove with a heart shaped body flanked by two more hearts. It has been painted with PA Dutch / Amish styled accent colors of blue green red and yellow. Measures 8 1/4 x 4. Rear markings: 260. Revision... I was calling this bird a turtledove until I received an email from a friendly eBayer (thanks lenka!) informing me that this is not a turtledove but rather the Mystical Distelfink with two heads so he is better able to watch more closely for evil to ward off and keep away from the distelfinks care giver. The farmer would also paint this bird on his barns to keep it and it\'s contents safe. That info got me curious and on the web site www.amishmarket.com I found this description of a hex sign with a similar design: Double Eagle (Courage) A large stylized double headed bird a double headed eagle is shown in this design. The eagle represents strength and courage. The trinity tulips add faith hope and charity; the heart add love. This design symbolizes strength and courage. This trivet doesn\'t have the trinity tulip but it does have the hearts and the bird looks like the double headed eagle shown on the hex sign. So it looks like it\'s not a turtledove afterall but either an Eagle or a Distelfink (goldfinch)!

This old mold is in remarkable condition considering it\'s age. It doesn\'t look like it was ever used. On the inside of the mold there was an old recipe card for Coconut Lamb Cake. The interesting thing is that most of the brands the recipe calls for are either no longer being made or are very old famous well used brands. For instance Swans Down Cake Flour Snow Frosting and Calumet Baking Powder. The recipe card is dated 1921. The lamb mold measures 13 and 1/2 in length by 8 in height. This old mold looks as if it was a promotional item for The General Foods Corporation in the 1920\'s promoting Bakers Coconut. The mold also has Baker\'s Coconut embossed at the bottom beneath the Lamb. This is a great old piece of advertising not to mention a wonderful collectible for the culinary person! This old Lamb mold would also just be a fabulous piece to display in a country kitchen. You also have the original old recipe card that came with the mold so there\'s no excuse not to put this old mold to use!! Best of all NO RESERVE . Personal checks or money orders accepted.

SHIPPING METHODS: The bidder may at any time request the shipping service of their choice to which will be added an appropriate handling fee. MEDIA: We have been shipping media items (records books etc.) by Media mail but have experienced slow delivery times so we are trying to move away from this service. Smaller light-weight media items over 13 ozs. are still quoted for Media mail and the bidder may request a different delivery service. However we WILL NOT be held responsible for the long amount of time any Media mail shipment may take. SMALLER ITEMS: Other smaller items up to 13 ozs. are shipped first class. All other items are shipped either Priority mail or FedEx. Usually anything over a few pounds is shipped via FedEx hence the higher costs. However their exemplary service is guarenteed carries automatic insurance up to $100 in value and is trackable with out additional cost. Any item shipped through the USPS Priority service without requesting additional services such as delivery confirmation can not be tracked nor will we be held responsibility for its not being delivered (see insurance disclaimer above). LARGER ITEMS: Larger items such as furniture and such are shipped either with BAX Global or a local mover we use who makes east coast runs every two-three weeks. HANDLING FEES: Since our shipping department needs to eat (and we require him to wear shoes please! ) and shipping materials do cost money (really!) all items have an appropriate handling fee. Basically the more time and care taken to prepare an item for safe transport the higher the fee. We do our best to provide both cost effective and careful handling of packaging your item.

The mischevious smirk on the Pixie\'s face says it all. The pot is labeled Mustard and has yellow stripes on a white background. The lid is a pixie with spoon below for serving the mustard. These spoons are very fragile due to the thin neck and prone to breakage - this one is in excellent condtion. Marked on the bottom: c1958 Holt Howard Japan with the Original H/H Japan foil label too!

Piece has overall crazing as can be expected with these. This item is as close to mint as they come. The only reason why I didn\'t call it mint is due to the crazing. However as I said most all of these Pixie\'s have crazing so you be the judge. Shipping: Safe secure professional shipping $9.00 to USA & Canada - Insurance optional/extra.

In 1986 a groundbreaking miniseries took the industry by storm revolutionizing forever the way people envisioned the comic-book medium. Now acclaimed writer/artist Frank Miller is set to do it again with the most anticipated comics sequel of all time... THE DARK KNIGHT STRIKES AGAIN. It\'s been three years since the events of THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS and everything is just fine. Perfect in fact. At least on the surface. What the world at large doesn\'t know is that it\'s a total sham. A perfectly choreographed pretty little world where everything that\'s ugly or even potentially disturbing is all nicely wrapped up with neat little ribbons and swept under the carpet. Only he knows better. He\'s watched it fester to near-breaking point and it\'s time for the only free man left who can effect any real change to bring it all down around their ears once and for all. It\'s not gonna be pretty. But at least it\'ll be honest. The Dark Knight returns once again -- trimmer more streamlined and with a vitality that hasn\'t been seen since the first years of his war on crime. Together with his army of Bat-soldiers including Carrie Kelley -- formerly Robin and now the new Catgirl -- the Dark Knight wages a new war on a diseased world that\'s become completely lost. But to fight this war successfully he must first return to being the World\'s Greatest Detective and discover what has become of his former allies who were once the World\'s Greatest Heroes. THE DARK KNIGHT STRIKES AGAIN will be told in 3-parts -- each issue a whoppin\' 80 pages in Prestige Format -- masterfully written and illustrated by Frank Miller and featuring the magnificent colors of Miller\'s collaborator Lynn Varley.

The designs of this region are varied and are not used as a guide to the origin of the rug. Distinctive designs are associated with particular towns and villages such as Bibikabad Ingelas Dergezin and Husianabad all are generally referred to as Hamadans. Key characteristics are similarities in weave and colors. Almost all Hamadans are single wefted a row of weft runs between each row of knots using the Turkish/Symmetrical knot with 40-100 knots per square inch. Most of the rugs of this region use similar strong dark colors including reds blues ivory and brown. Often they are woven mixing goat or camel hair mixed with wool or cotton. Designs are bold and geometric incorporating many hexagonal and diamond-shaped designs including sharply angled medallions and zigzag patterns which represent lightening. Stylized florals and utilization of the herati pattern are also quite common. Many older pieces mostly runners were woven on wool foundations with undyed camel hair and are therefore camel colored. Modern rugs have cotton foundations with stronger darker colors often with bright accent colors. It is now very rare to find them in the classic camel color. Hamadans are considered some of the best values in Persian rugs. _ Click HERE for answers to Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ).

So far it_s been my experience that it_s not quite perfected. Unless you_ve used it and are delighted with it please don_t click on checkout. When you click on it I get an email instructing me to send you an invoice. I_ve had several double payments as bidders think they must pay from it after they_ve already sent payment via paypal. Paypal is by far my favorite but Billpoint is also accepted. I_ll send an email when the auction finishes _ usually within the hour. On with the listing_. Today I\'m listing vintage textiles. Most of these were purchased at estate auctions. Because of that I have no accurate idea of the age. Unless stated otherwise you can expect them to be used and possibly stained. I\'ll do my absolute best to describe stains and any damage. Any piece that shows more than 2 or 3 small holes goes into the _cutter_ pile and will be listed as such. It\'s never my intention to misrepresent an item. Textiles are so difficult to list because I know as a buyer myself they are nice to feel before buying. Also any round white spots are probably camera lens spots. I_ll be happy to combine multiple wins to save on shipping costs. This tablecloth measures 56 x 76 inches. It has no staining - no holes. (We think the yellow napkins match - see my listing of dozens of napkins.) The color is a soft buttery yellow. If the cloth is turned upside down it\'s more like the napkins. I start all listings at $1.00 _ if possible. I know half of the fun of eBay is bidding (the other half is winning!). Email any questions before bidding. I reserve the right to reject bids from anyone with negative feedback regarding payment. Payment is requested within 10 days of the close of the auction _ please do not bid if you have no intention to buy. Iowa residents add 7% sales tax. Methods of payment accepted are money orders credit cards using Paypal.com & Billpoint and I will accept personal checks _ if you have at least 10 positive payment feedbacks. High bidder to add $5.20 toward shipping (international bidders see next paragraph). This amount does NOT include insurance _ I_m trying to keep your costs down. Insurance can be requested on any auction ($1.10 for the first $50 of value). I am not responsible for uninsured items or items that the post office loses. I pack as carefully as possible but accidents can occur. I am disappointed when something I order breaks and know that you are too. I_ve been shipping items for over a year and Priority Mail is the most cost effective method. Other arrangements can be made by request - especially on books and paper items. I try to watch for those winning multiple auctions and will combine for shipping savings. I mail Monday through Friday and your package will go out the next trip after payment is received _ I will email you confirming this. Because of ongoing difficulties with the Sioux City UPS customer counter I can only UPS parcels via Mail Boxes Etc. If you are an international bidder (this includes Canadians) you will need to send me your postal code and I will get you a shipping amount (for surface and air) at that time. I will not sign a customs form declaring the contents are a gift. I must let you know that the US Postal Service has discontinued the small packet rate. Shipping has drastically increased _ even to Canada. What I thought would cost $4 to ship was increased to $14. If payment is not received the following feedback will be left _ _as promised _ negative feedback due to nonpaying bidder_. I was kind last year and burned a few times. If your payment will be delayed please let me know - I understand things do happen. Thanks for taking the time to look and check out my other auctions for similar items!

I made the auction pages look the same so you\'ll still know its me and I will still combine shipping charges just as before regardless of which IDs auctions you bid on. ( If the picture does not appear click here for an alternate posting ) I accept MasterCard/Visa and checks/money orders in US funds. Checks hold to clear otherwise I ship within 24 hours. Buyer to pay $2.00 for first-class shipping/handling in the U.S. with insurance optional (but HIGHLY recommended) at $1 for each $50 of value. Seller is not responsible for lost items if insurance waived. Most small items can be shipped airmail overseas for $3.00. California buyers pay sales tax. Please ask any questions before you bid. Payment is expected within 10 days of auction close. Returns accepted within one week of receipt and are for bid price less shipping and fees unless the item received is not as described. Please DON\'T use eBay\'s \'Checkout\' on my auctions. In addition to being unreliable it only works on single items and most of my customers bid on multiple auctions. Until eBay makes Checkout optional the button will be part of all auctions whether the seller wants it there or not. Thanks so much for looking and good luck if you bid! rgelber Visit rgelber today!

Please view our other auctions for more great stuff!___________________________________: This is translated from a foreign site so please excuse the syntax and spelling::: Mayoria of the people when listening swastica immediately relates it to Hitler nazism but in fact this he is not simbolo of Nazi invention the swastica has old origins. Their roots according to some books of history overcome it to the Era of Bronze. The word Swastica or Cruz Gamada as some call to him is derived from the svastica sanscrito that ignifica s well-being. It was used in the antiguedad like simbolo of prosperity and good fortune simbolo of peace and alegria. It has been used in the primitive currencies of the old Mesopotamia by the Egyptians like representation of the power that each human being has in himself has been used in the buddhism also used like decoration amulet and talisman. This simbolo habia used in all the continents except in Australia before Hitler chose it like simbolo Nazi. Two types of swasticas exist the one that turns in opposite direction of the small hands of the clock that is sauvastika; and the one that turns in direction of the small hands of the clock (the Hakenkreuz) this was the used one by the Nazis usually is considered like simbolo to pave. The swastica usually represents the night and is used often in magical practices. This symbol was the maximum sign of the Divinity as it is it today the Cross for the Christians. The Nazi party decidio to use this simbolo like flag of its party in the year of 1919 and was when volume great height and by more than fifty years the Nazism of Hitler has followed alive in the sw_stica. The Nazi connotation that nowadays has the sw_stica is so strong that it cannot be forgotten. Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

Please note that the selvage may have one small hole every yard. The selvage is usually a narrow strip of fabric that runs along both sides of the material and is not used for upholstering.

Please ask any questions you might have about the item BEFORE you bid. If you have any reservations please do not bid as all sales are final. At auctions end we will send the winning bidder an email asking for their address so that we can calculate shipping charges. Due to space limitations we will only consolidate up to ten days worth of winning bids. The ten days begin after the first piece that you win closes. Unfortunately there are NO EXCEPTIONS to this rule as we are operating out of a small space and simply do not have the room to consolidate indefinitely. If you do wish to consolidate it is your responsibility to keep track of what you have won.

The first plate is Rockwell\'s painting of  Artists Daughter  a close depiction of Rockwell\'s own Self-Portrait. This painting shows a small girl at an easel painting a picture of her small cherished doll.The background lighting of the picture is a soft amber glow and the determination on the little girl\'s face is delightful. This is dated sixth in the series 1981 The second plate is the painting titled  The Tinkerer showing an old man and his cat tinkering away on an old copper teapot with a charming library background. This too is dated 1981 and is fifth in the series. Both plates are in mint condition with the exception of very small chips in the center rim of the back which are hard to see and do not affect the front of the plate at all.

The designs of this region are varied and are not used as a guide to the origin of the rug. Distinctive designs are associated with particular towns and villages such as Bibikabad Ingelas Dergezin and Husianabad all are generally referred to as Hamadans. Key characteristics are similarities in weave and colors. Almost all Hamadans are single wefted a row of weft runs between each row of knots using the Turkish/Symmetrical knot with 40-100 knots per square inch. Most of the rugs of this region use similar strong dark colors including reds blues ivory and brown. Often they are woven mixing goat or camel hair mixed with wool or cotton. Designs are bold and geometric incorporating many hexagonal and diamond-shaped designs including sharply angled medallions and zigzag patterns which represent lightening. Stylized florals and utilization of the herati pattern are also quite common. Many older pieces mostly runners were woven on wool foundations with undyed camel hair and are therefore camel colored. Modern rugs have cotton foundations with stronger darker colors often with bright accent colors. It is now very rare to find them in the classic camel color. Hamadans are considered some of the best values in Persian rugs. _ Click HERE for answers to Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ).

This is the periscopic sextant that was used by the USAF and CAF during the last 45 years. It was used on the B-47 B-52 C-54 C-97 C-118 C-119 C-121 C-124 KC-135 and other aircraft. It was used by the navigator or other crewmember to determine the altitude of a celestial body measured and recorded with reference to a bubble artificial horizon. A two power lens is incorporated into the periscope. Inertial and doppler navigation systems as well as GPS systems replaced the navigator and celestial navigation with this sextant. To illuminate the bubble and altitude counter a 28 volt D.C. aircraft supply was used. The sextant pictured below comes complete with a power connecting cable spare light bulbs and fiberglass storage case. It is in very good used condition but sold as is. This is a fantastic gift for an aviation memorabilia collector or former crew member on one of the above airplanes so don\'t delay in your bidding.

In 1986 a groundbreaking miniseries took the industry by storm revolutionizing forever the way people envisioned the comic-book medium. Now acclaimed writer/artist Frank Miller is set to do it again with the most anticipated comics sequel of all time... THE DARK KNIGHT STRIKES AGAIN. It\'s been three years since the events of THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS and everything is just fine. Perfect in fact. At least on the surface. What the world at large doesn\'t know is that it\'s a total sham. A perfectly choreographed pretty little world where everything that\'s ugly or even potentially disturbing is all nicely wrapped up with neat little ribbons and swept under the carpet. Only he knows better. He\'s watched it fester to near-breaking point and it\'s time for the only free man left who can effect any real change to bring it all down around their ears once and for all. It\'s not gonna be pretty. But at least it\'ll be honest. The Dark Knight returns once again -- trimmer more streamlined and with a vitality that hasn\'t been seen since the first years of his war on crime. Together with his army of Bat-soldiers including Carrie Kelley -- formerly Robin and now the new Catgirl -- the Dark Knight wages a new war on a diseased world that\'s become completely lost. But to fight this war successfully he must first return to being the World\'s Greatest Detective and discover what has become of his former allies who were once the World\'s Greatest Heroes. THE DARK KNIGHT STRIKES AGAIN will be told in 3-parts -- each issue a whoppin\' 80 pages in Prestige Format -- masterfully written and illustrated by Frank Miller and featuring the magnificent colors of Miller\'s collaborator Lynn Varley.

The same year Tenyo also released the Menta-Marvel effect. However unlike a majority of the Tenyo effects from the early 90s that are still in good supply Menta-Marvel has become very difficult to find. Another interesting aspect of the Menta-Marvel effect is that it retailed for a bit more than other Tenyo items of its time_I believe I paid around $25 or $30 for this. Menta-Marvel was created by Yutaka Sato and is now a discontinued Tenyo item. For those of you not familiar with the Menta-Marvel effect the back side of the packaging is shown in the picture below and gives a description of the effect. Supplied with the prediction board is a carrying case a chinese crayon (if necessary this can be replaced with a similar chinese crayon available at any office supply store) and also a cleverly-constructed set of ESP cards. The packaging has a few creases the plastic _bubble_ has a couple small cracks and some dirt marks however the apparatus appears to be in excellent condition. Here_s a chance to pick up what is possibly one of the most difficult post-_T-150_ Tenyo effects to find. If you have any questions about this trick or if you_re having trouble viewing the images please feel free to contact me through eBay_s _Ask Seller A Question_ feature.

Background is a soft shade of grey with a scenic garden design featuring green and grey leafed as well as pink blossoming trees garden statuary and columns. The colors feature several shades of grey green pink with some white accenting. The design shown in the first picture is repeated randomly across the panels. Each panel of this pair measures 33 across the top edge 67 across the bottom edge and are 44 in length with a generous 6 hem. They are lined with an ivory fabric which I believe is probably silk. They are a heavy weight and are obviously quite well made. The lighting in the first picture shows them to be a bit darker than they actually are; the second photo shows more of the true coloring. Due to the width of the panels there is a lengthwise seam running down each panel. This pair of vintage barkcloth curtains is one of 2 pair of the same design and color that I am listing. U.S. Shipping Cost: $8.50 Please contact me for International Shipping Rates as they are slightly higher. Multiple purchases from my auctions can be combined to save on shipping costs. Condition: These drapes are in excellent condition. They have been well taken care of by the previous owners. There are no stains holes or worn spots that I can find. The colors are still bright. The ivory lining (which I believe is silk but am not guaranteeing) has darked some from age somewhat more noticeably so in the folds but I see no evidence of water staining etc. As with the barkcloth the lining also does not have any noticeable holes or tears.
